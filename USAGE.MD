# Using the GUI

The GUI is mainly divided into 2 parts, the home screen and the settings screen(s). 

- The home screen is where you can click the add files button and select one or multiple files.

- Once you select your files use the start all button to start running ccextractor on the selected files one by one. 
- You can see the live output in the Logs container below. 
- You can also use the clear list button to remove all the selected files from the menu. 
- The progress for each file is shown with a circular green progress indicator. 
- You can cancel/remove any file from the selected files using the delete button. 
- To stop ccextractor, simply press the stop all button.

## Settings screen(S)

The GUI has tons of options so they are seperated into several settings screens. All of the options are saved locally in a json file so you can save the settings you need frequently, details of which are as follows:

- Each setting screen has a current command container at the top which shows you the exact command with the selected settings you will run when you click start all on the home page. 
- To update the settings, simply toggle the option or select the option from the dropdown menu. 
- **To save settings which have a textfield press enter after you enter your setting value in the textfield.** 
- You can also reset the settings back to the default value with the reset settings button on the top right corner of each of the settings page.
